## Trailer

[![Shark Hunt - Reveal Trailer](https://i.imgur.com/EOlaCy0.png)](https://youtu.be/1kWwF1yRNHA)

## Description
In Shark Hunt, You are a treasure hunter who is looking for the rarest submarine pearls in the world to make a fortune. 

But there is a rumor that there are dangerous sharks in the area. You better be discreet or you will risk your life in an epic fight. **Whoâ€™s the best between the man and the beast?** 

Train in the swimming pool then dive into the mysterious ocean, discover more tools and more challenges across the levels. 

### Built with VR in mind 
Enjoy the breathtaking undersea environment in VR. Accelerate underwater by doing realistic swimming breaststroke movements.

Seek well, grab the shells and physically open them with your knife to get their precious pearl!

Fight sharks using a knife and harpoon. The harpoon is good at distance but slow (depends on how fast you can reload :p). The knife is good at close range, impale for more damage!

#### You couldn't imagine what it's like to have a great white shark coming at you. Now you can live it.
