## Description

In Vermin Exterminator, step into a not-so-distant future where climate change drives desperate animals into urban areas. The worst part? They appear to be evolving in abnormal ways. As an elite exterminator agent, your duty is to face a variety of evolved vermin, including insects, spiders, rodents, and snakes.

Experience true VR innovation as you manipulate your gauntlet to switch weapons and interact with your surroundings in immersive ways. Open drawers, move objects and use items as melee weapons to seek out vermin, adding an extra layer of excitement to your missions.

In HQ, equip yourself with a diverse arsenal of powerful weapons and tools to make the most of your high-end gauntlet before you embark on your missions.

Venture into breathtaking house and office environments and immerse yourself in a narrative-driven experience. Investigate the phenomenon threatening the city, unlocking new enemies, weapons, tools, and locations as you progress through the story. Inhabitants need you: take on secondary challenge-driven missions to earn money and upgrade your arsenal.

#### Are you ready to save the city from these disgusting threats?
