Mineo Games was invited to participate in the **Salon de La Flèche 2021** exhibition.

Due to covid, some things were different from usual... First thing, the location was unique: **the city of La Fleche's cinema** 🎞.

It was the perfect occasion to reveal **Shark Hunt** 🦈 to the public!

**For that we made a special reveal trailer that would be projected at the event:**

And to have a demo, we worked hard to integrate the fight with the shark and correct a lot of bugs in time 🥵.

We had built a stand on the theme of **Shark Hunt**: special decorations like warning signs, oysters with pearls, shark head, pencil cup...
We even provided shark-shaped candies to treat players' taste buds 🍬!
We also prepared business cards and posters showing QR codes linking to _Mineo Games_ social networks and _Patreon_ page.

We organized a game that recalls Shark Hunt's gameplay to win prizes 🎲. People may plunge their hand into the bag and pick up a pearl to participate, and each pearl color allows you to win a different prize.

- Black pearl = shark anti-stress
- White pearl = Mineo Games pencil
- Blue pearl = shark stickers
- Silver pearl = Mineo Games coaster

During the show, I participated in an interview 🎤 with other actors in the video games industry. We talked about what brought us to jump into our passion job, what excites us in the upcoming technologies,...
_It felt like both a daunting and fantastic experience!😛_

**Relive the round table here:**

**Can you guess who came?**
The special guest this year was [Marcus](https://twitter.com/marcuszeboulet), a famous french video games journalist.
He is a funny guy and a VR enthusiast. It was nice to talk with him and watch him play Shark Hunt, and his encouragement cheered me up a lot!

Many players came to try Shark Hunt and face their fear 😱; even children weren't afraid!
Watching players apprehending the game and getting them feedback was much helpful. 🙏

## What did I learn?

A point to improve would be the testing preparation phase. It took a lot of time and repetition to teach everyone the gameplay and controls of the game. 😣

Mainly everything was new for me as it was my first exhibition as an exhibitor. I realized the hardness of the task: talking to many people at the stand and on stage is very tiring.

Overall, this first exhibition has resulted in a step up for Mineo Games 🚀. **A success that motivates to continue with passion!** 🤩
