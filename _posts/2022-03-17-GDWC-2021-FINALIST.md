Mineo Games participated in the **Game Development World Championship** for the first time in 2021. This online contest aims to enlighten indie developers' work worldwide.

We presented Vermin Exterminator in the **Best VR Prototype** category, competing with about a hundred participants.

We worked to make the game more immersive by adding some new enemies skins and weapon effects.🐀🐍🕷🦟🔥

The jury liked our game because they selected us to be in the TOP 5 finalists. We were both surprised and proud. 🙀😚
