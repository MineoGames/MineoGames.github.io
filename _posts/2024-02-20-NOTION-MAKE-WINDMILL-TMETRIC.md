## Introduction {#introduction}

üõ∏ Project management is an important element, and not even a video game studio can be exempt from it. It's complicated enough as it is, so if we could use a unique tool on a daily basis, it would be easier.    

Find out how I optimized task tracking without spending a penny more. Or how I went from **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, **[ClickUp](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** and **[Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/3-126651)** to simply **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** and **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)**. And finally, what role automation can play with tools such as **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** or **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**. Interested in learning more about it? Let's dive right in!

## Old Workflows {#old-workflows}

Before finding my current setup, I used **[ClickUp](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** (**paid plan**) for task management, **[Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/3-126651)** (**free plan**) for time tracking, and **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** only for documentation and note taking (**free plan**). 

Although these tools worked reasonably well together, switching between different apps was cumbersome, and some limitations were apparent even within **ClickUp**'s paid small team plan. 

<img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/IQ6Z-aPhr1wAAAAd/date-everywhere-data.gif" alt="Data everywhere"  class="small"/>

As a result, I looked for a more flexible, versatile, and integrated solution tailored to my needs.

## Goodbye ClickUp, Hello Notion {#goodbye-clickup-hello-notion}

üëã Using **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** (**previously known as Integromat**), an automation tool that lets you build your own scenarios, I managed to move my entire database from **[ClickUp](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** to **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** automatically. It required simply mapping the corresponding information between the two platforms.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1zLgd1J.gif" alt="Migration scenario with Make"  class="large"/>

_The migration process in action: different paths are taken depending on whether or not the tasks already exist, preventing duplicates._

Thanks to **Notion**'s **customization** of databases, I was able not only to replicate many features present in **ClickUp**, but to go even further by interconnecting tasks with documentation, dashboards etc.

To build my space in Notion, I followed the P.A.R.A. method, which organizes content by dividing them into:
* üöß**Projects**: projects respond to a üèÜ**Goal**, itself segmented into üìç**Milestones**. 
* üé®**Areas**: the various major areas in which we operate
* üìÅ**Resources**: specialized sub-sections of a domain
* üìÅ**Resources**: specialized sub-sections of a domain
* ü™î**Archives**: so that completed elements do not pollute but can be consulted. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x61V3xL.png" alt="Area example"  class="small"/>

_üí°You can find various **Notion** templates implementing this method online too._

By consolidating everything into one platform, I saved myself from having multiple software opened at once. Then, I added formulas to display the data according to my preferences and created views essential to my daily routine.

## Managing Time with TMetric {#managing-time-with-tmetric}

‚è±Ô∏è Since native time tracking isn't available in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, I tried several options and ultimately decided upon **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)**. Its [browser extension](https://tmetric.com/help/apps/browser-extension/how-to-install-browser-extension) makes it easy to record time spent on each task straight from the **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** interface.

_Time tracking becomes effortless when there is a button readily accessible on the Notion page._

## Automations with Make {#automations-with-make}

üí∞ Automations aren't included in the free tier of **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, but **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** offers a cost-effective solution. When it comes to automations, **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** has incredible potential. While I utilize just a fraction of its capabilities, they have been sufficient enough to streamline my workflow significantly.

Here's an example of an automation I made: whenever a new task gets created in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** assigns the same project as its parent task automatically. This saves manual intervention and ensures consistency across related tasks under their designated category in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** filters.

_Two separate branches handle cases involving child tasks differently than standalone ones._

## Centralize Data with Windmill.dev {#centralize-data-with-windmilldev}

‚öôÔ∏è During my search for automation solutions, I discovered **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, a fantastic alternative to **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** specifically designed for developers. With its ability to call APIs directly, manipulate data using **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, show log outputs, and self-host for unrestricted usage, **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)** goes beyond standard connectors.

<img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/qgQUggAC3Pfv687qPC/giphy.gif" alt="D√©veloppeur faisant de l'automatisation"  class="small"/>

Thanks to **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, I connected **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** and **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)** to store all tracked data directly inside **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/s0YTioq.png" alt="Data flow with Windmill.dev"  class="small"/>

_This flow takes a specific date input; otherwise, it defaults to yesterday's tasks. The duration is then added to the respective Notion task (so I could exploit it)._

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

üåü Combining **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, and **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)** led me to cancel my subscription with **[Clickup](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** and gain greater flexibility and control over my data.
