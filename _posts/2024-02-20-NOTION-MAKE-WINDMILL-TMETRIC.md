_An example of task previews before and after using both Notion and ClickUp._

üõ∏ Join me on this exciting journey where I share my personal experience managing projects without spending any extra money. By combining **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)**, and **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)**, I found an ingenious way to replace ClickUp and Harvest. Interested in learning more about it? Let's dive right in!

## Old Workflows {#old-workflows}

Before finding my current setup, I used **[ClickUp](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** (**paid plan**) for task management, **[Harvest](http://try.hrv.st/3-126651)** (**free plan**) for time tracking, and **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** only for documentation and note taking (**free plan**). Although these tools worked reasonably well together, switching between different apps was cumbersome, and some limitations were apparent even within ClickUp's paid small team plan. As a result, I looked for a more flexible, versatile, and integrated solution tailored to my needs.

## Goodbye ClickUp, Hello Notion {#goodbye-clickup-hello-notion}

üëã Using **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** (**previously known as Integromat**), an automation tool that lets you build your own scenarios, I managed to move my entire database from **[ClickUp](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** to **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** automatically. It required simply mapping the corresponding information between the two platforms.

_The migration process in action: different paths are taken depending on whether or not the tasks already exist, preventing duplicates._

By consolidating everything into one platform, I saved myself from having multiple windows open at once. Additionally, customizing my databases in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** allowed me to replicate many features present in **[ClickUp](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** while also introducing new capabilities. To create my space in Notion, I followed the PARA method, which organizes content by dividing them into Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. You can find various free templates online too. Then, I added formulas to display the data according to my preferences and created views essential to my daily routine.

## Centralize Data with Windmill.dev {#centralize-data-with-windmilldev}

‚öôÔ∏è During my search for automation solutions, I discovered **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, a fantastic alternative to **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** specifically designed for developers. With its ability to call APIs directly, manipulate data using **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, show log outputs, and self-host for unrestricted usage, **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)** goes beyond standard connectors.

Thanks to **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, I connected **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** and **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)** to store all tracked data directly inside **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**.

_This flow takes a specific date input; otherwise, it defaults to yesterday's tasks. The duration is then added to the respective Notion task._

## Managing Time with TMetric {#managing-time-with-tmetric}

‚è±Ô∏è Since native time tracking isn't available in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, I tried several options and ultimately decided upon **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)**. Its browser extension makes it easy to record time spent on each task straight from the **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** interface.

_Time tracking becomes effortless when there is a button readily accessible on the Notion page._

## Automations with Make {#automations-with-make}

üí∞ Automations aren't included in the free tier of **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, but **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** offers a cost-effective solution. When it comes to automations, **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** has incredible potential. While I utilize just a fraction of its capabilities, they have been sufficient enough to streamline my workflow significantly.

Here's an example of an automation I made: whenever a new task gets created in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, **[Make](https://www.make.com/en/register?pc=mineogames)** assigns the same project as its parent task automatically. This saves manual intervention and ensures consistency across related tasks under their designated category in **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)** filters.

_Two separate branches handle cases involving child tasks differently than standalone ones._

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

üåü Combining **[Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/ooivbv8j8mmc)**, **[Windmill.dev](https://windmill.dev)**, and **[TMetric](https://tmetric.com)** led me to cancel my subscription with **[Clickup](http://clickup.com/teams/project-management)** and gain greater flexibility and control over my data.
