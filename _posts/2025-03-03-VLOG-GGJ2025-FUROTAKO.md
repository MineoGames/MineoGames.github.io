## üõ† **Day 0 ‚Äì Arrival & Team Formation** {#day-0--arrival--team-formation}

### **What is a Game Jam?**  {#what-is-a-game-jam}

A **Game Jam** is a **48-hour game development challenge** where teams must create a game from scratch based on a **surprise theme**. These events test your **creativity, teamwork, and urgency skills**.

<img src="/img/blog/GGJ2025.webp" alt="Global Game Jam 2025" class="small mb-3"/>

### **Team of Stangers**  {#a-team-of-strangers}

I arrived at the **√âcole de Design de Nantes** on Friday evening for my first-ever **in-person Global Game Jam**. The energy in the room was electric, with over 100 people buzzing with excitement. I had teamed up in advance with two talented artists‚Äîa **3D artist** and a **3D animator**‚Äîbut given the scale of the event, we saw an opportunity to **expand our team** with more diverse skills.

While enjoying some pizza, we mingled with other teams and ended up merging with a group that brought essential **UX/UI design, concept art, and sound design skills** to the table. Our final **7-person team** was now complete!


## **Brainstorming & Game Concept** {#brainstorming--game-concept}

The Game Jam theme was revealed: **"Bubbles**." The best practice for a game jam is to avoid wasting time finding a game idea. 
<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_WhiteBoard.gif" alt="Furotako Brainstorming" class="small"/>

Our minds raced through different hypotheses:
<div class="bullet-none" markdown="1">
- üçæ **Champagne Escape** ‚Äì Playing as a bubble of champagne trying to break free from a bottle.
- üö¢ **Bubble Cannon** ‚Äì A ship shooting at airborne enemies with bubbles as ammo.
- üèÉ‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è **Bubble Rush**(our final choice) ‚Äì A bath toy jumping on bubbles to escape the tub.
</div>

We chose the last one because it struck the perfect balance between **fun, simplicity, and feasibility** within 48 hours. The variety would come from **level design and creative obstacles** rather than overly complex mechanics.

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_Concept_Motion.gif" alt="Furotako Motion Concept" class="small"/>

## **Project Setup** {#project-setup}

With our game idea locked in, we needed a proper indie game development workflow.

I jumped into setting up the project structure:

- **Initialized a GitHub repository** for proper version control.
- **Created a Notion workspace using UGO** to manage tasks, documentation, and references.
- **Set up a Figma board** for concept art and UI mockups, natively integrated inside Notion.
- **Initialized the Unreal Engine 5.5 project** using the **third-person template** to kickstart development.

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_Git_Notion.gif" alt="Furotako Tool Stack" class="big"/>

By the end of the night, we had:

- A **clear game concept** and visual references.
- Our **first prototype**: a sphere that lets the player bounce, forming the foundation of the bubble jumping mechanic.

## **üëæ Day 1 ‚Äì Development Begins** {#day-1--development-begins}
The night was short, but at least we were guaranteed some sleep with the location closing from midnight to 8 am.<br>
*Game Jam Tip*: Don‚Äôt sacrifice sleep and eat; it won‚Äôt help your brain function at its full potential.
<img src="/img/blog/GGJ2025_Breakfast.gif" alt="Furotako Tool Stack" class="small"/>


While eating our breakfast, we brainstormed several ideas for the game, but **Furotako** stood out.

<div class="bullet-none" markdown="1">
* üêô *"Tako"* means **octopus** in Japanese.
* üõÅ *"Furo"* means **bath**‚Äîa perfect match for our bathtub escape concept!
</div>

The name clicked **instantly**, and we knew it had **branding potential**.

From there, No√© and Manuel designed the **logo** to feature the **main character**‚Äîour little bath-time octopus‚Äîright in the text. It captured the fun, quirky spirit of the game perfectly**.** üé®‚ú®

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_Logo.webp" alt="Furotako Tool Stack" class="small"/>

By the way, let me introduce you to the team! 

### **Role Assignments** {#task-assignments}

We divided responsibilities to keep production smooth:

- **[Manuel DelaHaye](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-delahaye-310ab52a1)** ‚Äì Concept Art & 2D Art
- **[Hugo Dubot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hugo-dubot-3d/)** ‚Äì 3D Modeling & Animation & Game Feel
- **[Guillaume Escarieux(me)](https://linktr.ee/mineogames)** ‚Äì Programming & Integration
- **[Jwhy](https://www.jwhy.fr/)** ‚Äì 3D Modeling & Rigging & Animation
- **[Victor Malbet](https://www.instagram.com/victor.mlbt.design/)** ‚Äì Game Design & Level Design
- **[No√©](https://www.instagram.com/noe_makethings/)**¬†‚Äì Game Design & UI Design
- **[Carla Zafimahova](https://www.instagram.com/carlazaf_design?igsh=cDI1MDlneWhkaGZw)** ‚Äì Music & Sound Effects

![The Dream Team](/img/blog/Furotako_Team_Transparent.webp "The Dream Team")


### **The Moment We Knew the Game Would Be Fun** {#the-moment-we-knew-the-game-would-be-fun}

The real magic happened when we:

- Implemented the **bubble-jumping mechanic**, making it feel responsive & fun üéÆ
- Saw the **octopus animated** for the first time in Maya üêô‚ú®
- Contemplated the **procedural sponge** made in HoudiniüßΩ
- Listened to the **joyful unique soundtrack**, setting the perfect mood üé∂


### **Biggest Challenges** {#biggest-challenges}

- **Git Issues:** We ran into version control problems due to unperfect usage, which slowed us down (fixing merge conflicts and remaking lost content‚Ä¶).
- **Time Management:** As the only full-time developer, I had to **balance my own tasks while helping the team** with technical difficulties and formation. It was challenging to stay productive while constantly switching contexts.

### **Progress So Far** {#progress-so-far}

By the end of **Day 1**, we had:

- A **playable prototype** with bubble jumping that pops out.
- Some props mechanics like floating shampoo, gliding soap and sinking sponge. *I mean, there are just cubes at the moment* üòö
- Some **early-level design** with a giant bathtub with real water from UE5.
- All **concept art finalized,** and some **3D models**.
- The **music track.**

## **‚è≥ Day 2 ‚Äì The Final Stretch & The Disaster** {#day-2--the-final-stretch--the-disaster}

**Jwhy surprised us** by modeling the **Duck Police Officer**  (the villain) overnight. 

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_Duck.webp" alt="Duck" class="small"/>

### **Last-Minute Additions & The Final Push** {#last-minute-additions--the-final-push}

With just **a few hours left**, we scrambled to **polish everything**:

- **Final obstacle gameplay mechanics** implemented (bath balls, siphon with drain, baby's hand crushing down randomly, duck patrolling‚Ä¶)
- **Every game asset** was being integrated‚Äîlogo, cover, and 3D objects with collisions.
- **Sound design** came together, adding satisfying bubbling pops, octopus jumps, and hits.

<audio controls class="center mh-2">
  <source src="/sound/blog/Furotako_DuckSound.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
But time was **flying**. We were deep into **crunch mode**, barely looking at the clock.

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_LevelStart.gif" alt="Final Gameplay" class="medium"/>

### **Then... Disaster Struck** {#then-disaster-struck}

It was time to **deliver the game,** and we rushed to finalize everything.
<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_Outatime.gif" alt="Time is running out" class="small"/>

Then we hit a **huge problem**‚Äî **the menu didn‚Äôt work**. No way to start the game.

ü´¢‚Äú*Why leaving that part to the very end?*‚Äù

I scrambled to fix it, **pushing past the deadline**, and after some quick debugging, I **finally** got the menu working. Relief‚Ä¶ or so I thought.


Then came **the next disaster**‚Äî **the game wouldn‚Äôt launch.**

At first, I thought, *‚ÄúOkay, normal bug, easy fix.‚Äù* But no.

üíÄ **Panic mode activated.**

The rest of the team stood behind me, watching as I tried to fix it.

Meanwhile, other teams were already presenting their games on the giant screen.

We tried everything:
<div class="bullet-none" markdown="1">
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Exporting a new build.** ‚Üí Didn‚Äôt work.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **I ran it on my PC.** ‚Üí It was too slow.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **We moved it to another PC via USB.** ‚Üí CRASH.
* ‚úîÔ∏è **Tweaked Unreal settings & re-exported.** ‚Üí Still CRASHED.
</div>
Finally, **one version launched on my PC**. Not great, but at least we had a playable build.

### Game Jam Fail: What to Do When Your Game Won‚Äôt Launch? {#game-jam-fail-what-to-do-when-your-game-wont-launch}

We stepped onto the stage. **I thanked everyone on the mic** (Atlangames, the School of Design, my team), feeling a mix of exhaustion and pride.

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_Talking.webp" alt="Final presentation" class="small"/>

We hit **"Play"** in front of the entire audience.

üí• **Black screen. Fatal error.**

<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_CrashAudience.webp" alt="Crash in front of the audience" class="medium"/>
Silence üò®.

We tried **another PC**‚Äîthe one we had already tested before. **CRASHED AGAIN.**

The audience waited. The tension was unbearable.

There was **only one PC left** in the team that hadn‚Äôt been tested yet.

This was it. **Our last shot.**
We plugged in the USB, booted up the game, and hit **"Play."**

üî• **BAM. IT WORKED.**‚ú® 


The audience **loved it**‚Äîcheering at every near-miss jump, laughing at the **Duck Cop** boss, and groaning in disappointment when the octopus sank.

It was an **insane** rollercoaster, but we survived the Game Jam. **Furotako was alive.** üéÆüêô


<img src="/img/blog/Furotako_OfficialDemo.gif" alt="We made it!" class="medium"/>

## **üöÄ Final Thoughts & Lessons Learned** {#brainstorming--game-concept}

After **48 hours of madness**, here‚Äôs what I took away:

<div class="bullet-none" markdown="1">
* ‚úÖ **Test early, test often.** We underestimated the final export‚Äînever again.
* ‚úÖ **Organizing saves time.** Using **UGO for planning** kept everything smooth, even when time was tight.
* ‚úÖ **Crisis management** is a real skill. Game jams are a **trial by fire** for problem-solving.
* ‚úÖ **Big teams work better -** if structured properly. Despite being seven people, we delivered all planned features thanks to clear roles and processes.
* ‚úÖ **Have fun during the process**. Even if we hadn‚Äôt ended shone, we‚Äôd earned a new game and new friends in just a weekend! 
</div>
Would I do it again? **100%**.

But next time, I'll prepare the tools and project in advance with pre-made menus. It will be mandatory to package the game regularly to avoid experiencing that same level of stress!
