## 🚨 Why So Many Game Projects Die {#why-projects-die}

Let’s be honest: starting a game is exciting. Ideas come fast. Prototypes appear in hours.

But finishing? That’s where motivation crashes, scope explodes, and projects quietly disappear into your archive folder.

After years of repeating that cycle, I asked myself the tough question:

> Is it really about talent and time — or is it about **methodology**?

Because when I was a Software Engineer, I could pass the delivery phase of digital products successfully.

## 🔧 What Changed for Me {#what-changed}

What changed wasn’t my skills or tools.  
It was **how I organized** everything:

- I stopped improvising  
- I started scoping clearly  
- I broke features into user stories, user stories into tasks  
- I estimated real durations  
- I started logging progress daily

That’s when I finally saw real progress.

So I built myself a system — one I could rely on.

And I used it to ship a full project from idea to release.  
That project? UGO itself.😁

## 🧰 Building the Ultimate GameDev Organizer (UGO) {#building-ugo}

**UGO** stands for **Ultimate GameDev Organizer**. It’s a Notion system I built to help indie creators:

- Set realistic scope  
- Track tasks and deadlines  
- Structure production into milestones  
- Use Agile sprints in a simple, dev-friendly way  
- Avoid burnout while still finishing their game

Initially, I made it for me. But I realized others were struggling with the same things. So I turned it into a template anyone can use.

## ✅ What UGO Actually Does {#what-it-actually-does}

Here’s what’s inside the system:

- 📁 **PARA doc organization** (Projects / Areas / Resources / Archives)  
- 📅 **Agile board** with custom filters for sprint progress, teams, tags  
- 📝 **User story breakdowns** with time estimates  
- 📊 **Backlog views by feature group, priority, and milestone**  
- 🧠 **Daily logs** to reflect on progress and log dev time  
- 🧮 **Actual vs. estimated time tracking**  
- 🎯 **Goal → Milestone → Task structure**  
- 📂 **Asset tracker** and cross-linked documentation  
- 🧭 **Marketing checklist, release roadmap, and project timeline**

No fluff. Just a system to help you stay on track — and actually ship.

## 🎯 Who UGO Is For {#who-ugo-is-for}

UGO was built for:

- 🧑‍💻 Solo developers who start fast but struggle to finish
- 🧠 Studio teams who want clarity for smooth collaboration, even under time pressure  
- 🎓 Game dev students or hobbists looking for pro structure  

It’s flexible enough for one-person projects, and scalable for studio-size tasks.

### 💬 What’s Your System?

I’d love to know — how do *you* organize your game dev process?  
What’s helped you stay on track and actually finish?

Feel free to reach me on Discord or email me at guillaume.escarieux@mineogames.com. 
Let’s build better games — and finish them too.

## ❓ FAQ {#faq}

### **What is UGO?**

**UGO (Ultimate GameDev Organizer)** is a Notion-based productivity system designed specifically for game developers.  
It helps manage scope, tasks, documentation, sprints, time tracking, and more — all in one place.

---

### **Can UGO help me finish my game?**

That’s exactly what it’s for.  
UGO is built to move you from "endless prototyping" to actual release.  
By structuring your backlog, sprint planning, and time tracking, it keeps you grounded and focused through the full production cycle.

---

### **I’m a solo developer. Isn’t this overkill?**

Not at all. UGO is made for solo devs too.  
In fact, it was originally created by one. Everything is flexible and scalable — use only what you need, and hide the rest.

---

### **What’s the difference between UGO and Tiny GameDev Organizer?**

**Tiny GameDev Organizer (TGO)** is a free, simplified version of UGO — great for game jams, fast prototyping, or students starting out.  
UGO is the full version, designed for longer or more complex projects with more structure.

🆓 Try TGO here → [Get TGO on Gumroad](https://mineogames.gumroad.com/l/brhdg)

---

### **Do you have a real example of UGO in action?**

Yes — we used UGO to plan and ship our **Global Game Jam 2025** project, *Furotako*.  
It helped us stay organized during tight deadlines, from task tracking to post-mortem review.
