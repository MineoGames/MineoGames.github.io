## Trailer

*Coming soon...*

## Description
In Shark Hunt, You are a treasure hunter that is looking for the rarest submarine perls in the world. 

But there is a rumour that there are dangerous sharks in the area. You better be discreet or you will risk your life in an epic fight. **Whoâ€™s the best between the man and the beast ?** 

Train in the swimming pool then dive into the mysterious ocean, discover more tools and more challenges across the levels. 

### Built with VR in mind 
Enjoy the breathtaking undersea environment in VR. We have built an realistic swimming system (and also a comfy one).

Seek well, grab the shells and really open them with you knife to get their precious pearl!

Fight sharks using knife and harpoon. The harpoon is good at distance but slow (depends on how fast you are able to reload :p). The knife is good at close range, impale for more damage!

#### You couldn't imagine what it's like to have a great white shark coming at you. Now you can live it.
